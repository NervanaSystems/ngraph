Visualization Tools
###################

One option for visualizing the graph or node structure of a graph is to compile 
with the :envvar:`NGRAPH_ENABLE_VISUALIZE_TRACING` flag. This generates a PDF, 
though it is not ideal for viewing large graphs.  

To inspect larger graphs, it may be necessary to convert ``.json`` files 
generated by nGraph to ``graphml`` format, allowing them to be inspected with 
third-party tools capable of handling very large graphs. We've provided the 
following (unofficially-supported) script: `ngraph_converter.py`_ 

What follows here is a non-comprehensive list of third-party visualization tools 
for loading and analyzing graphs.   

#. `Netron`_ 

#. `Gephi`_

#. `Cytoscape`_ 

#. `Tensorboard`_
