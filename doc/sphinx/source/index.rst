Intel nGraph
============

An open-source C++ library for evolving deep learning 
------------------------------------------------------

Intel nGraph library provides a suite of components to promote computational 
efficiency and enable portability of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models defined in 
a variety of frameworks. The library translates a framework's representation of 
computations into a neutral-intermediate representation specifically designed to 
run better on target hardware, on both Intel and non-Intel platforms.
