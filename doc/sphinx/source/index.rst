nGraph Compiler stack 
######################


nGraph is an open-source graph compiler for :abbr:`Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)`. 
The nGraph Compiler stack provides an inherently efficient graph-based compilation 
infrastructure designed to be compatible with many upcoming 
:abbr:`Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)`, like the Intel® Nervana™ 
Neural Network Processor (Intel® Nervana™ NNP), while also unlocking a massive 
performance boost on any existing hardware targets for your neural network: both 
GPUs and CPUs. Using its flexible infrastructure, you will find it becomes much 
easier to create Deep Learning (DL) models that can adhere to the "write once, 
run anywhere" mantra that enables your AI solutions to easily go from concept to 
production to scale.

Frameworks using nGraph to execute workloads have shown `up to 45X`_ performance 
boost compared to native implementations. For a high-level overview, see the 
:doc:`project/introduction` and our latest :doc:`project/release-notes`.
