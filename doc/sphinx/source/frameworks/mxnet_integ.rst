MXNet\* bridge
===============

* See the `README`_ on nGraph-MXNet repo.

* **Testing inference latency**:  See the :doc:`validated/testing-latency` 
  doc for a fully-documented example how to compile and test latency with an 
  MXNet-supported model.     

* **Training**: For experimental or alternative approaches to distributed 
  training methodologies, including data parallel training, see the 
  MXNet-relevant sections of the docs on :doc:`../distr/index` and 
  :doc:`How to <../howto/index>` topics like :doc:`../howto/distribute-train`.
