.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] Benchmarking performance of DL systems is a young discipline; it is a
   good idea to be vigilant for results based on atypical distortions in the 
   configuration parameters. Every topology is different, and performance 
   changes can be attributed to multiple causes. Also watch out for the word 
   "theoretical" in comparisons; actual performance should not be compared to 
   theoretical performance.
