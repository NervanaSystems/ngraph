A bit about languages that work, either indirectly or directly, with 
components in the nGraph Library.

.. _plaid:

PlaidML
========

The framework of a :abbr:`Machine Learning (ML)` environment can make use of 
some specific kinds of optimizations with the help of a language-based utility, 
such as `plaidml`_.  PlaidML can provide a C API for some kinds of integrations or 
optimizations very similar to what is documented in :doc:`../fusion/index`.  

The `PlaidML` :doc:`../programmable/index` backend component is an alternative 
way to use work done with the `tile` language. To get started with the interpreter 


Recent work on new adaptations and use cases is coming in more detail soon; 
see the documentation on `tile`_ in the meantime. 



.. _halide:

Halide
=======

The `halide-lang`_ language is "designed to make it easier to write high-performance 
image processing code on modern machines. Its front end is embedded in C++. Compiler 
targets include x86/SSE, ARM v7/NEON," and others.
