Release Notes
#############

nGraph is provided as source code, APIs, build scripts, and some binary formats 
for various Compiler stack configurations and use cases. 

For downloads formatted as ``.zip`` and ``tar.gz``, see 
https://github.com/NervanaSystems/ngraph/releases.

This page includes additional documentation updates.

We are pleased to announce the release of version |version|.


Core updates for |version|
--------------------------

+ All ops support ``Output<Node>`` arguments
+ Additional ops
+ ONNX handling unknown domains
+ Provenance works with builders and fused ops
+ ``RPATH`` for finding openmpi
+ Negative indices/axes fixes
+ Migrate some ``get_argument`` removals


Latest documentation updates
----------------------------

+ Note the only support for nGPU is now through PlaidML; nGraph support for nGPU 
  (via cuDNN) has been deprecated.  
+ iGPU works only with nGraph version `0.24`.
+ Add new Sphinx-friendly theme (can be built natively for an alternative to ngraph.ai docs). 
+ Update PaddlePaddle documentation to reflect demo directories instead of example directory.
+ Update doc regarding the validation of ``Sum`` op.


.. important:: Pre-releases (``-rc-0.*``) have newer features, and are less stable.
