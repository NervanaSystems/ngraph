Homomorphic Encryption (HE)
===========================

* **Encryption with Intel® HE transformer for nGraph™** 

  * The `Intel HE_transformer`_ enables deep encryption with nGraph Backends.

  * `Blog post`_ with `examples`_

    .. note:: Some implementations using TensorFlow* may also work with the  
       `nGraph Bridge repo`_ if older versions of ``ngraph-tf`` are not 
       available.
