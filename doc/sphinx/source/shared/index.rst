Subgraphs 
=========

As the toolbox for Deep Learning (DL) developers becomes more powerful and 
better able to target workloads with both local and remote data, it becomes 
increasingly important to be able to work in collaborative spaces like 
subgraphs.  

Intel nGraph Library is designed to allow the framework considerable leverage in 
what optimizations can be done either for :abbr:`Ahead of Time (AoT)` compilation 
scenarios, or for :abbr:`Just in Time (JiT)` execution of training workloads.
More details on these compilation scenarios is coming soon.
