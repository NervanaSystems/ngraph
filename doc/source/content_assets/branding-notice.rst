Reserved Trademarks and IP
==========================

The Intel® nGraph™ library is an open source project. It consists of a number 
of trademarked IP components that are able to be integrated with a number of 
frameworks, modules, extensions, or other libraries that may be wholly or 
partially open source. Intel's nGraph library provides component reference and 
organization, and includes documentation designed to help data scientists, 
appliance developers, framework authors, algorithm engineers, and others integrate 
code across various components.
