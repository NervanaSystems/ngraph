Reserved Trademarks and IP
==========================

The Intel® nGraph™ library is an open source project. It provides component 
reference and organization, and includes documentation designed to help data 
scientists, appliance developers, framework authors, engineers, algorithm 
designers, and others integrate code across various components.

The Intel nGraph library documentation includes a number of trademarked IP 
components that can be integrated with a variety of frameworks, modules, 
extensions, or other libraries that may be wholly or partially open source. 

Like many open source projects, this library was designed to be compatible
