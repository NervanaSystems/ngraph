# nGraph Code Examples

`You are at: ngraph/doc/examples/README.md`

The code examples in this folder are for documentation purposes. 
Any modifications to the code or comments on example programs 
in this directory have DOCUMENTATION BREAKING IMPLICATIONS. You 
are welcome to refactor these code examples, if you think they 
can be made more clear; however, you must also find and update 
all `.rst` documentation files affected by your change(s). Every 
example file added to this directory must be accompanied separate 
and proper documentation files formatted in `.rst`, as per the 
specification in our [doc contributor README] file.
