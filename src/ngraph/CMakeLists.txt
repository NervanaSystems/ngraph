# Default installation location for cmake usually is /usr/include or /usr/local/include
# which requires sudo access on most servers. Also, this creates a problem for the shared
# development systems (e.g., build servers).
#
# Therefore we are setting the installation directory so that by defult "make install"
# won't override artifacts generated by other users.
#
# The user can always override this by using the cmake command listed below.

# External
# Requirements:
# - In NGraph, there are multiple include paths set for different external projects.
# - However, we want one single include path for external projects from the TF bridge side, while
#   making sure that the `#include` files can still be resolved.
# - Therefore, when `make install`, the include directory will be "flattened" for each external
#   projects respectively.
