# Intel® nGraph™ library 

Welcome to Intel® nGraph™, an open source C++ library and compiler. This 
project enables modern compute platforms to run and train Deep Neural Network 
(DNN) models. It is framework-neutral and supports a variety of backends 
used by Deep Learning (DL) frameworks. 

The nGraph library translates a framework’s representation of computations into 
an Intermediate Representation (IR) designed to promote computational efficiency 
on target hardware. Initially-supported backends include Intel Architecture CPUs, 
the Intel® Nervana Neural Network Processor™ (NNP), and NVIDIA\* GPUs. 
Currently-supported compiler optimizations include efficient memory management 
and data layout abstraction. 

See our [install] docs for how to get started. 

For this early release, we provide [framework integration guides] to compile 
MXNet and TensorFlow-based projects.
