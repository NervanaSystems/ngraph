# Intel® nGraph™ library 

Welcome to Intel® nGraph™, an open source C++ library and compiler. This 
project enables modern compute platforms to run and train Deep Neural Network 
(DNN) models. It is framework-neutral and supports a variety of backends 
used by Deep Learning (DL) frameworks.

See our [install] docs for how to get started. 

For this early release, we provide [framework integration guides] to compile 
MXNet and TensorFlow-based projects.  If you already have a trained model, we've
put together a getting started guide for [how to import] a deep learning model 
and start working with the nGraph APIs.
