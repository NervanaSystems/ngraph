# Intel® nGraph™ library  project

Welcome to the Intel nGraph project, an open-source C++ library for developers
of code for Deep Learning (DL) systems and frameworks. Here you will find a 
suite of components, documentation, and APIs that can be used with Deep Neural 
Network (DNN) models defined in a variety of frameworks.

The nGraph library translates a framework’s representation of computations into 
a neutral-:abbr:`Intermediate Representation (IR)` designed to promote 
computational efficiency on target hardware; it works on Intel and non-Intel 
platforms.

See our [install] docs for how to get started. 

For this early release, we provide framework integration guides to compile 
MXNet and TensorFlow-based projects.  

Integration guides for each of these other frameworks is tentatively
forthcoming and/or open to the community for contributions and sample
documentation:

* Chainer, 
* PyTorch, 
* Caffe2, and 
* Frameworks not yet written (for algorithms that do not yet exist).
