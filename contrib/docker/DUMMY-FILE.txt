This file is created (in branch chrisl/test-merge-trigger) so I have a change
on a branch, which then allows me to create a pull-request.  The pull-request
is then used to test the Jenkins merge job which I am setting up.  If there is
no change on a branch, then Github intelligently does not let you create a
pull-request.  (Seems a little too hand-holding to me, but there you have it.)

If you have any questions about this file, please contact me (Chris Lishka).
This file should never appear on the master branch -- it should only ever exist
on branch chrisl/test-merge-trigger, which will be deleted once the merge-
trigger is working.
